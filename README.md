![Blue Triangle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aerolfos/stellaris_mod_deploy_action/main/assets/blue_caution_triangle.png) Supports Stellaris version: `0.0.0`

This is a GitHub template for mod projects, used to create new repositories. Replace all instances of `TEMPLATE` when using to create an actual mod. Remember the links too in `README.md` and `workshop.txt` both.

Mod files should be nested and placed into the `aero_mod_template` directory in the repository. Rename this folder to have the same name as the GitHub repository for the mod.

This template is set up to be used with the [Stellaris Mod Deploy Action](https://github.com/aerolfos/stellaris_mod_deploy_action), see that for more information.
